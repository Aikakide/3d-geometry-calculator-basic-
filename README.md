Geometrical calculator

2D Shapes: area, perimeter, diagonal lengths, side ratios, and angles for triangles, rectangles, squares, polygons, and circles.

3D Shapes: volume, surface area, lateral area, slant height, height-to-radius ratios, and volume-to-surface ratios for cylinders, pyramids, cones, and spheres.

Trigonometric calculations for regular polygons, 3D mesh calculations for cylinders/cones/spheres, and geometric ratios to compare shapes.
